     *  The dynamic window defines the local search space for the robot
     *  It is constructed of a set of translational (x, y) and rotational (Î˜) velocities
     *  It is then filtered in three ways:
     *  -- Only the velocities where the robot can still safely stop
     *  -- Only the velocities reachable by the next time step
     *  -- Only the velocities that avoid colliding with obstacles
     *  
     *  A velocity is then chosen from the remaining set by maximizing a fitness function that accounts for:
     *  -- Progress toward the goal
     *  -- Forwad velocity of the robot
     *  -- The closest obstacle to the current trajectory
